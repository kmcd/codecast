So you can see clearly text editor and and online 15 if we scroll down you can

load text editor alias from the terminal I comment out the prompt and reload

which is an alias and now open the text editor again to customise the prompt so

in search history for every time you typed in alias H is an alias itself for

history and then search the history listing for text pattern so give me a

listing along listings directory so if you use this command many times great

alias so you can create an alias LL and you can use that with of argument as

long as five space at the end of the alias so if we scroll down through the text

editor see online 25 a alias to open up the Ruby on rails guides which I find

very handy to have that on the command line instead of having to type an URL

when you're developing 

so online 34 and I have an alias to open number of text
files files in my text editor so this means find all files matching text pattern

so he you see a listing of all text files in this directory listing of all text

files T followed by anything ending in.txt now open in my text editor if you

enclosed expression in `spirit will evaluate the expression and impersonal

argument the command the effect being that you "fires in your text editor okay

type is a command which will show you how an alias function is defined is quite

handy aliased number, you are not sure what arguments are into the alias here

you can the JL is an alias it open and okay and all those files are opened in

separate buffers in the text Pam's environment variable which shows you all the

executable's our for your environment you can see if you hit tab dollar capital

dollar followed by it will expand out all of the variables and random just

generates random number should be quite useful are in reality I don't use many

variables they are quite useful of and variables which are used and okay so if

in your home directory a you may want to create Shell scripts various things

like I know downloading document station a build script for are your software

tools so touches the command which will create a file more update the timestamp

of an existing file topic and in this file weekend rightly commands that you

need to download until say rails okay change mode which is a command which

changes the operating mode of the existing command and plus X means that make it

executable I don't use change mode many times you can see and download rails X

means is achievable
